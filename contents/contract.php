I, Tete. Logovi agrees to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2024, Web 250 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. 
I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I swear that I will only use these resources to learn and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
